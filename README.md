# Predictive-Maintenance-with-Sensor-Data
Overview
This project develops a predictive maintenance system designed to analyze machinery sensor data to anticipate necessary maintenance. By using machine learning algorithms, it detects patterns and anomalies in the data, enabling predictions about potential equipment failures. This proactive approach helps reduce downtime and maintenance expenses.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for the project.
Pandas: For efficient data handling and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
TensorFlow: For deep learning model development.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data insights.
FPDF: For creating PDF reports.
Project Structure
data/: Stores sensor_data.csv for sensor data management and report generation.
models/: Holds trained models, including RandomForest and TensorFlow models.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
scripts/: Includes utility scripts for specific tasks.
main.py: The main script that executes the entire workflow.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.x and the necessary packages are installed. Install required packages via:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib fpdf
Running the Project
Initialize Data: Running main.py will create the CSV file if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
Load and Process Data: The script loads existing data, processes it, and trains both a RandomForest model and a TensorFlow model.
Generate Reports: The project generates and saves performance reports in PDF format.
Simulate Sensor Data: It continuously simulates real-time sensor data and appends it to the CSV file.
To execute the full workflow, run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
